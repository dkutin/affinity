# Affinity for Spotify
![](https://github.com/dkutin/affinity/workflows/Deployment/badge.svg)

Using Spotify's ability to score tracks based on 'affinity', I created an app that visualizes your change in music taste over time. 

## Motivation
Being a big fan of music, and listening to it for 6 hours a day while coding, I wondered what my music taste progression would be like from the time I started using Spotify, until now. Because of this, I created an app that visualizes different metrics available from the Spotify API to help visualize your music taste. 

## Usage
https://dev-affinity.herokuapp.com/

** Work in Progress ** 

Log in through spotify to see a visualization of your last 20 songs and common metrics associated with them.  

## Roadmap
 - Show user metrics based on song stats (ie. How danceable is your music? How wordy is it? Tempo, etc.).
 - Improve UI and Front-end design (as back-end was the main focus thus far).
 - Set up more workflows and contributing guidelines to encourage community contributions.
